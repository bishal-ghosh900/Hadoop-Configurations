After the creation of VM with bridge Adapter, we will modify /etc/hosts for both VM (as 2VM is created).
Bridge Adapter will set different ip address for all of the connected VM.

1. ifconfig -> use it to get the ip address of the VM

2. change to root user using -> sudo su

3. change directory to home dir by cd command only -> cd 

4. edit the the /etc/hosts -> gedit /etc/hosts
   Ex: 
	127.0.0.1		localhost
	192.168.0.107	m1               <------ ip address and machine name row wise
	192.168.0.106	m2		     <------ ip address and machine name row wise

5. Check both machines are connected or not using ping command -> ping m1 (from m2) <-- and --> ping m2 (from m1) 

6. we can also disable the firewall using -> ufw disable

6. apt-get install openssh-server

7. create ssh private and public key file using -> ssh-keygen -t rsa -P ""
   This step is only for passwordless connection to other machine. This step will create a id_rsa and id_rsa.pub file.
   We need to copy that public key ( the file with .pub extension ) to another machine

8. copy the ssh public key using -> ssh-copy-id -i $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub bishal@m2 (from m1) 
   Same should be done from m2 also.
 
9. to connect to m2 from m1 use -> ssh m2 (from m1)

10. now to be able to ssh to the same machine we need to copy $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub content to $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys using 
    -> cat $HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub >> $HOME/.ssh/authorized_keys

11. download hadoop and jdk tar.gz file in one machine. And after installing it one machine we can easily copy those downloaded files
    to another connected machine.

12. untar jdk-download.tar.gz in /usr/lib/jvm using and hadoop-binary-download.tar.gz in /usr/local/ -> 
	1. sudo tar -xvf /home/bishal/Downloads/jdk-download.tar.gz
	2. sudo tar -xvf /home/bishal/Downloads/hadoop-binary-download.tar.gz

13. set the ownership of this files using ->
	for jdk -> chown -R root:root jdk-download		<---- first root is the user and second root is the group
	for hadoop -> chown -R bishal:bishal hadoop

14. create a soft link for hadoop using -> ln -s /usr/local/hadoop-download /usr/local/hadoop 

15. add few lines in /home/bishal/.bashrc -> 
	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/jdk
	export HADOOP_INSTALLED=/usr/local/hadoop
	export PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME/bin
	export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_INSTALLED/bin
	export PATH=$PATH:$HADOOP_INSTALLED/sbin  <-- we are adding it cuz it contains start and stop command 
    								    files of hadoop (ex: start-all.sh, stop-all.sh) 
16. refresh the .bashrc using -> source .bashrc

	After this check java and hadoop version to check if they are successfully installed or not.

17. we can copy any files from m1 to m2 or m2 to m1.
    To securely copy anything we use scp command
    we will copy the downloaded jdk and hadoop binary tar file to /tmp folder of m2 machine from m1 machine using -> 
	1. scp /home/bishal/Downloads/jdk-download.tar.gz bishal@m2:/tmp
	2. scp /home/bishal/Downloads/hadoop-binary-download.tar.gz bishal@m2:/tmp

18. untar and set ownwership of these file as instructed above in m2 machine too.

19. copy the .bashrc from m1 machine to m2 machine /home/bishal folder

20. refresh the .bashrc file

	After this check java and hadoop version to check if they are successfully installed or not.


21.
